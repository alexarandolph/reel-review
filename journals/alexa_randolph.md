Today we forked and cloned our gitlab repo and discussed how we would manage our branches. Initially we were each going to work on our own self-titled branches, however we determined this may complicate things once we get further into the implementation phase. Our wireframe is almost complete and we're focusing on hashing out the API endpoints. Because we will be using FastAPI instead of Django we're contemplating our options with data relationships from our user, review, and media objects.
