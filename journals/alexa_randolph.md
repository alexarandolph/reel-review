Today we forked and cloned our gitlab repo and discussed how we would manage our branches. Initially we were each going to work on our own self-titled branches, however we determined this may complicate things once we get further into the implementation phase. Our wireframe is almost complete and we're focusing on hashing out the API endpoints. Because we will be using FastAPI instead of Django we're contemplating our options with data relationships from our user, review, and media objects.

My group asked Jimmy to review our wireframe and API endpoints. He pointed out a few areas for improvement and encouraged us to provide more detail on the flow of our website. This led to further discussion on what we want our application to achieve and how to execute. Towards the end of the day we were able to reach a conclusion on our reviews page as well as how all our response shapes should flow regarding the API endpoints.

Today our team worked through the "project set up" module in Learn. We mainly worked on our docker-compose.yaml file to ensure it was updated with the correct applications/versions needed. We decided to go the PostgreSQL route so we set up and installed all the necessary components to connect our server with pg-admin. Changing the name of our file from `sample_service` to `reel_review` caused some complications with Docker. Ultimately we were able to find a workaround by commenting out the original `fast-api` specifications in the yaml file.

Our group began working on queries today and completed the pg-admin administration. Once we began working on our queries we slowly realized that we weren't as familiar with Fast API as we need to be. We decided to complete the create account function we were working on and spend the rest of the night re-watching the explorations in order to get a better handle on the new material.

Today our group was able to finish up the authentication feature. Our decision to re-read the material in Learn really helped us to figure out the components that we needed to get the feature working. We are spending the second half of our coding session on syncing our 3rd party api and creating our initial list views/routes. We are hoping to get our backend completed by end of next week.
