Today we forked and cloned our gitlab repo and discussed how we would manage our branches. Initially we were each going to work on our own self-titled branches, however we determined this may complicate things once we get further into the implementation phase. Our wireframe is almost complete and we're focusing on hashing out the API endpoints. Because we will be using FastAPI instead of Django we're contemplating our options with data relationships from our user, review, and media objects.

My group asked Jimmy to review our wireframe and API endpoints. He pointed out a few areas for improvement and encouraged us to provide more detail on the flow of our website. This led to further discussion on what we want our application to achieve and how to execute. Towards the end of the day we were able to reach a conclusion on our reviews page as well as how all our response shapes should flow regarding the API endpoints.
