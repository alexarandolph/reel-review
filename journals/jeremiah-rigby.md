# **February 9th, 2023:**
Received our starter code from gitlab today and I am setting up my own journal to begin my daily writing.
We as a group are also trying to finish up the wireframe and api endpoints.
I plan on studying FASTAPI over the weekend


# **February 13th, 2023:**
We worked mostly on setting up the database and docker files. Bradley drove most of the afternoon. And I drove after afternoon break.
There is definitely a little bit of confusion on if we are doing things correctly. but we are pushing along and will troubleshoot as we run into any erros
