Received our starter code from gitlab today and I am setting up my own journal to begin my daily writing.
We as a group are also trying to finish up the wireframe and api endpoints.
I plan on studying FASTAPI over the weekend


# **February 13th, 2023:**
We worked mostly on setting up the database and docker files. Bradley drove most of the afternoon. And I drove after afternoon break.
There is definitely a little bit of confusion on if we are doing things correctly. but we are pushing along and will troubleshoot as we run into any erros


# **February 13th, 2023:**
We worked much of the day on setting up our database and fixing bugs. The information given from learn for us to copy is not what is actually needed so under the instruction of one of our instructors we undid a lot of the damage that learn did and got our yaml file to a more functional and understanable code. We also spent a little bit of time working on the account queries in the afternoon. Todays drivers were Myself, Bradley, and Alexa.
