 Got our gitlab repository today and I set up my personalized journal after cloning. I worked with my group as best I could so we could complete our wireframe and API endpoints. I am waiting for specific information for FastAPI so we can better understand our approach. I did learn how tokens will work when utilizing them in our system.

# **February 10th, 2023:**
Today we learned an idea of how the Token works. We fine tuned our API endpoints and better learned/understood how they are to be represented to both the user side and the dev side. We presented our endpoint mapping. This weekend I will focus on the basics of FastAPI and PostgresSQL for the start of our backend.

# **February 13th, 2023:**
Over the weekend, I viewd some instructional videos on setting up and establishing FastAPI basic as well as data through SQL. Today, I viewed and started to understand the authentication process for starting our project. We as a full group set up our initiation files for windows computers and set up our yaml. We also set up our relational database as per the instructions in learn.

# **February 14th, 2023:**
We learned how to make calls from tables within a project. Today, for our specific project, we covered the primary establishment of our database as a group of 4. We made sure it was functional and shifted over to seting up our queries. We are reviewing the lessons from learn to better understand how to do routes to complete the core of our backened.

# **February 15th, 2023:**
As a group of 4, we completed out full authentication process. This included our query and routers. We cycled through the full processes. We also figured out the way tot get a signin key for this since that was a hangup on approach. We have now shifted to working on our api movie database pull for backened use.

# **February 16th, 2023:**
We are having many API issues today. We figured out our key and how to trouble shoot avoiding the VS code key. We we able to pull in the database from our API but the implementation is different in many ways and we are sorting the system so we can figure it out accordingly. Weekend time, so independently working/reading commences so we can pool our ideas next week.

# **February 21st, 2023:**
Over the weekend we got together and corrected our code for our main API database. We got everything functional. Today we went through and created all our endpoints for our API database in the list form and details for both our API database and our review internal database. We also made our code more concise on the backened. We hit a small wall on the authentication so we will read/learn up and return tomorrow to tackle that issue

ABSENT: As per team- just to update you on what happened today we were able to fix the authenticator. It was working the whole time we just needed to migrate after creating a new table on our database. We then moved onto front end and we're kinda just sculpting bare bones routes and we're studying the explorations/prepping for front-end authentication.

# **February 23rd, 2023:**
ABSENT: As per team-just to update you, we are still kinda stuck on front end auth...we are able to log in on the front end and get a token, but for some reason our auth is having trouble actually reading it so we plan on going to riley in the morning. In addition, we were able to protect the back end routers along with return the appropriate status code for the create/delete requests. All in all we are progressing well with our last main block being the final portion of this auth

# **February 24th, 2023:**
Today we started with the flake 8 setup. We also fixed our authorization completely and set up our login and create requests for accounts. We also set up the inial homepage setup as well as the nav bar for our services. Today, my personal wall was based on docker not  launching my ghi container. This weekend I will catchup on the current ccode and start the download/setup for tailwind.

# **February 27th, 2023:**
We implemented 3 areas of our React fronend. First, we set up the link from our main search of movies to link and display specific details. We then linked the detail option directly to the Review forms and implemented the system to fill and submit the form. We established the search bar for movies which have the same link process as normal homepage. We also created the base form of our welcome page. Tonight we study a small amount for our tailwind and set up to complete our reviews list/details tomorrow.
