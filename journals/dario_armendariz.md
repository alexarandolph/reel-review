# **February 9th, 2023:**
 Got our gitlab repository today and I set up my personalized journal after cloning. I worked with my group as best I could so we could complete our wireframe and API endpoints. I am waiting for specific information for FastAPI so we can better understand our approach. I did learn how tokens will work when utilizing them in our system.

# **February 10th, 2023:**
Today we learned an idea of how the Token works. We fine tuned our API endpoints and better learned/understood how they are to be represented to both the user side and the dev side. We presented our endpoint mapping. This weekend I will focus on the basics of FastAPI and PostgresSQL for the start of our backend.

# **February 13th, 2023:**
Over the weekend, I viewd some instructional videos on setting up and establishing FastAPI basic as well as data through SQL. Today, I viewed and started to understand the authentication process for starting our project. We as a full group set up our initiation files for windows computers and set up our yaml. We also set up our relational database as per the instructions in learn.

# **February 14th, 2023:**
We learned how to make calls from tables within a project. Today, for our specific project, we covered the primary establishment of our database as a group of 4. We made sure it was functional and shifted over to seting up our queries. We are reviewing the lessons from learn to better understand how to do routes to complete the core of our backened.
