# **February 9th, 2023:**
 Got our gitlab repository today and I set up my personalized journal after cloning. I worked with my group as best I could so we could complete our wireframe and API endpoints. I am waiting for specific information for FastAPI so we can better understand our approach. I did learn how tokens will work when utilizing them in our system.

# **February 10th, 2023:**
Today we learned an idea of how the Token works. We fine tuned our API endpoints and better learned/understood how they are to be represented to both the user side and the dev side. We presented our endpoint mapping. This weekend I will focus on the basics of FastAPI and PostgresSQL for the start of our backend.
